//! Cycle collector.
//!
//! RustCFML's reference-typed containers (`CfmlStruct`, `CfmlArray`, `CfmlQuery`),
//! closure capture scopes (`Arc<RwLock<ValueMap>>`) and flyweight component
//! instances are `Arc`-refcounted, so a reference *cycle* (`a.other = b;
//! b.other = a`, a closure stored into the scope it captures, every component's
//! `this → variables → this`) is never reclaimed by refcounting alone — its
//! internal refs keep `strong_count > 0` even after every external root is gone.
//! In a long-lived `--serve` process that builds cyclic graphs (Preside, ColdBox,
//! WireBox), this leaks on every request and RSS climbs without bound.
//!
//! This module reclaims those cycles with **trial deletion** (Bacon–Rajan) over
//! a log of the containers a request allocated. It does NOT replace refcounting:
//! the acyclic garbage is still freed eagerly, on-thread, with zero pause. It
//! never walks the whole heap and never stops other requests. User-facing
//! description: `docs/memory.md`.
//!
//! ## When it runs
//! * **Mid-request** — `collect_incremental`, from component construction, once
//!   the young log reaches its budget: a MINOR sweep over the young entries
//!   promotes survivors to an OLD generation; a MAJOR sweep covers both once the
//!   old generation has doubled.
//! * **Request end / `cfthread` body end** — `collect` over everything logged,
//!   deferred (`defer_current_log`) while a thread the request started is still
//!   running, because the two share scopes.
//! * **Across requests** — `collect` carries live survivors into a
//!   process-wide, `Weak`-held set, swept once it has doubled. This frees what
//!   became garbage AFTER the request that made it.
//! * **On displacement** — overwriting or deleting a key in a `persistent_scope`
//!   struct (the application scope, static scopes, class structs) re-enters the
//!   displaced graph into the log (`relog_cycle_nodes`); a large one schedules a
//!   cross-request sweep (`sweep_if_displaced`). This is what frees a framework
//!   reload's old generation.
//!
//! ## How it stays correct without tracing the persistent scopes
//! The `Arc::strong_count` itself is the oracle. A survivor that is still
//! referenced from outside the set being swept (application/session/server
//! scope, a live frame, a seed) has a strong count greater than the number of
//! references it gets from inside the set; a pure cycle does not. So we compute,
//! per node `n`:
//!
//! ```text
//! external(n) = strong_count(n) − 1 (our own probe handle) − internal_in(n)
//! ```
//!
//! `external(n) > 0` ⟺ `n` has an owner outside the set ⟹ `n` is a live root.
//! We mark the transitive closure of the roots live, and everything else is an
//! unreachable cycle: we clear its backing (dropping its outgoing refs) so the
//! whole subgraph's counts fall to zero and it frees. A node whose lock can't be
//! taken without waiting has its edges skipped, which can only under-collect.
//!
//! ## Safety w.r.t. threads
//! Reading `strong_count` is only stable if no other thread is concurrently
//! cloning/dropping the same `Arc`. A truly-internal cycle (the only thing we
//! ever collect) is unreachable from any other request's thread by construction;
//! anything shared across threads escaped to a shared scope and thus reads as a
//! live root. The one case to guard is *this* request's own `cfthread`s, which
//! share `application`/`request` scope by Arc — so a request or thread body that
//! still has a running thread defers its log instead of collecting it.

/// between two set members is still found by the mark phase via whichever member
/// is live. Only a genuine cycle with no external owner is ever reclaimed.
